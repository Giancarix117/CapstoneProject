For example, if a company is trading at Rs. 20 per share that produces EPS of Rs. 1 annually, then its P/E ratio is 20 which means that the share price is 20 times the company’s earnings on an annual basis.
Debt to Equity Ratio- The debt-to-equity ratio helps in determining how much the company is in debt. High levels of debt are bad as it signals bankruptcy.
