One paper with confirmation of your job with official details (job title, working hours, how many weeks you worked there, etc.) 
signed by your supervisor or manager. And the second we need short report (2-3 pages) with description of projects you worked on.
Some people combine this into one document.

Due to the NDA contract I signed when i started working with Telus, I wont be able of making a deep dive into certain topics, 
but I will provide an overview of what each project entailed. 

First and foremost, my responsibility was to protect the users while they were accessing the platform. This was composed of multiple
tasks, such as:
1. Deleting any content that may be offensive.
2. Deleting content that may facilitate locating an user.
3. Reviewing threats and escalating them to the proper authorities if we deemed a threat may be carried out.
4. Removing deceitful content which may trick a user into revealing information they normally would not. 
5. Monitor for malicious links thay may contain malware and other malicious content. 
6. If a user seemed to be in distress or required professional help, I would provide them the resources necessary. 
7. Deleting content that may promote hate or violence. 
8. Reducing the spread of misinformation. 
9. Removing content that provided restricted goods and services
10. Removing innapropriate content
11. Age-gating certain content to protect minors. 
12. Removing scams and other content meant to take advantage of users. 

I also received plenty of trainings in order to comply with company policy and regulations.
1. Phishing training
2. Insider threat training
3. Spam training
4. Security breach training
5. Clean desk training
6. Chain of command training
7. Incident response training.
