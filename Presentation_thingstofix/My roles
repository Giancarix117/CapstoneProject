I was the one and only member of the security team for TIPL, and since I conducted both offensive and defensive activities,
I opted for calling myself the purple team.

As
Chief security officer, I had to make sure we were following the secure development best practices. I communicated clearly with the developers
to make sure everything was implemented with a security mindset.  Implementing security from the beginning is a given,
since doing it later would be much more expensive and complicated. 

Purple team leader: As the one and only member of the purple team,  I conducted both offensive and defensive activities. This included
the inital vulnerability assesment and the penetration test

Cloud security officer: GCP makes up a big part of our back-end. It is complex with a lot of moving parts, so making sure it was
secure was one of the more challenging tasks. 

IAM admin: Identitification and authorization management is a tedious process that must be managed correctly, or it can lead to sustantial
security breaches. Every account must follow the least privilege principle.

Web App Security Officer: On top of everything else, additional security measurements had to be applied to the web applications.
Configuring the firewall, input validation, setting X-XRFT tokens, among other items.
