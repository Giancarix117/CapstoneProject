1. Secure code review is the process of reviewing and analyzing software code for potential security vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
The goal of a secure code review is to identify and address secuiryt issues early in the software development lifecycle, before
they can be exploited by attackers.

At TIPL, we are strong believers in security by design. Ensuring that we prioritize security from the beginning is the best way to 
keep our data and assets safe, since it may be costly and time consuming to implement later. 

Failures in Identification, Authentication, and Access Control:
Mishandling of identification and authentication can lead to serious repercussions. With proper access control policies and by implementing
zero trust, each account is limited to access only what they need. 

Potential Exposure of Sensitive Data:
Potential exposure of sensitive data occurs when a company unknowingly exposes sensitive data or when security incident leads to 
the data being compromised. Thhis could potentially ruin a company, since data such as PII and SPII is heavily protected by the 
government, and if company IP is exposed, it could spell the end.

Inadequate error handling:
By itself, inadequate error handling wont cause too much damage. However, displaying too much information regarding an error could
provide an attacker with the necessary data to carry out an attack. Rather than providing lengthy errror messages, we display
error codes with minimal information. 

Injection Flaws:
Injections occur when an attacker supplies malicious input into the site. Ths could lead to a plethora of attacks, such as leaking
private data, modifying information stored in databases, injecting malware, and other nefarious activities. By implementing proper
measurments such as input validation and keeping our interal services and processes secure, we can greatly reduce the risk of a 
successful injection.
